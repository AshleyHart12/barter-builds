# Barter Builds

Barter Builds is a platform that connects **small businesses** who need websites with **talented developers** who want to trade their skills for goods and services. No money requiredâ€”just fair exchange.

## ðŸŒŸ Why Barter Builds
Many small businesses cannot afford professional web development services or have no idea how to get started, while many developers seek opportunities to build their portfolios and gain real-world experience.  
Barter Build solves this by creating a marketplace for **skills-for-goods barter**: small businesses get the websites they need, and developers get compensated with valuable goods or services in return.
